Class Description: _"2 lecture; 2 laboratory hours. Basic concepts in data science. Topics covered are data collection, integration, management, modeling, analysis, visualization, prediction and decision making, data security and data privacy. Important statistical methods will be explored. Emphasis will be on applying data analysis methods to real-world data. Metrics for evaluating the quality of various methods will be presented.  Students will complete hands-on experiments for analyzing and visualizing data sets using GUI interfaced software and Python programming in the labs."_

**Project Background (from project notebook):** _Walt Disney Studios is one of the most successful film and television studios of all time. With a massive library of over 500 productions, acquiring properties from Marvel and 20th Century Fox, and with the potential of reaching its 100th anniversary in the next decade, there’s no doubt that they left a lasting legacy. While the company is known for its mark of quality, the films it produced are so engrained in (western) culture, that people often find themselves comparing the elements of successful films to some other Disney property. But what exactly is this mark of quality? By using data of the gross income of 579 Disney movies, it is possible to highlight the studio’s greatest strengths._ <br>
